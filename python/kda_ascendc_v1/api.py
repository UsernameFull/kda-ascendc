# MAXH heads per block, so a smaller define silently drops heads).
# The fp32 state is 32 KB of UB per head and stays resident, so all the
# staging has to fit in the rest of this part's 192 KB.  R3 halved that
# staging by aliasing it across the two phases the loop alternates (stage 2
# and stage 4, each of which opens with a PIPE_ALL drain): 112.5 KB -> 56.5 KB
# at C=64, 46.5 -> 26.5 KB at C=16 (kernels/v1/k2_persistent_loop.cpp carries
# the budget).  That is what makes 4 heads fit at every chunk size -
# 128 + 56.5 = 184.5 KB of 192 at C=64, 128 + 36.5 = 164.5 at C=32 - where
# the old layout capped C=64/32 at 2 (176.5 KB).  A UB overrun is a
# kernel-side aivec error, not a host-side allocation failure, so this is
# arithmetic, not a probe.
# Heads per block is not a free knob: it sets the block count, and the
# block count sets the waves, and the second wave costs a whole second
# pass over the chunks.  The kernel's head map strides by the runtime
# block count ("for (h = blk; h < BH && nh < MAXH; h += NBLK)"), so any
# heads-per-block in 1..PERSIST_MAXH is one nblk away.  The old form
# here chose "one wave per AIC" for the 24-core golden device (96 heads
# / 24 = 4 heads/block); this part has 20 AIC cores, and full-call
# device events read the three candidates at [1,8192,96,128] (interleaved
# MIN, tools/probe_k2_maxh_wave.py, bit-identical outputs incl. the fp32
# state): 24 blocks x 4 heads = 2 waves = 8 head-steps -> k2 4.025 ms;
# 32 x 3 = 2 waves = 6 -> 3.081 ms; 48 x 2 = 3 waves = 6 -> 3.276 ms.
# The picker below therefore searches whole-wave block counts and takes
# the smallest waves x heads, ties to the larger block (3 heads wins
# the 6/6 tie against 2 by retired work and prologue: 3.081 vs 3.276).
# On the 24-core part the same search keeps 4 heads/block, and one head
# per block stays available only while it fits a single wave (the old
# 4.38-vs-4.55 note at [2,4096,8]; past that a second wave of one-head
# blocks loses the engine overlap badly, 17.2 vs 13.8 at [1,8192,32]).
# nh = 1 is not just "one fewer head": the depth-one flag protocol only
# overlaps the two engines when a block has two or more heads in flight, so at

    The substitution runs on M = CHUNK/SB sub-blocks (k1_solve_wu_wide.cpp) and
    the coupling block X21 = -X22 L21 X11 is left to the Cube
    (k1_solve_assemble.cpp), which cuts the row recursion's M^3/2 vector lanes
    per chunk by SB^2 and leaves the Cube the part it is actually good at.

    The wide half occupies the vector cores and the assemble/Cube half the Cube
    cores, so the chunk range is cut into ``overlap`` slices and the two halves
    run on their own streams behind a per-slice event - at [1,8192,96,128] and
    CHUNK = 64 that takes the stage from 3.22 to 2.51 ms with bit-identical
    outputs.  Slice sizes are whole AIV waves by default (docs 11.59,
    ``_solve_slice_chunks``); KDA_SOLVE_SLICE_CHUNKS overrides the size (>0)
    or restores the legacy even split (<0).  Slices hold whole ``unit``
    (wide block / assemble / Cube unit)
    groups, which is what keeps a padded tail from leaking into the next slice;
    ``overlap = 0`` runs everything on the caller's stream.  ``c`` is the real
    chunk count: the wide/assemble halves own c-sized-per-chunk buffers padded
    up to ``c_solve``, but rk/rv/W/U only carry the c real chunks, so the Cube
    launch - whose kernel clamps its loop to the count it is handed - has to be
    clamped to them (a padded count sends the tail block's stores past W/U).
    ``pmid`` (the assemble's P tile, 25.2 MB per call at [1,8192,96,128] - the
    50.3 MB in section 11.39 is its GM round trip, write plus read) is passed as
    None when the load mode keeps P on chip: the caller does not allocate it,
    ``_pack_ptrs`` writes a null pointer, and the kernel never dereferences it
    (docs section 11.40).  Modes 0/1 own the tile and need it non-null, so this
    is a property of the mode, not of the call site.
