// K1 stages 1+2 fused: input normalisation, gate/decay preparation and the
// intra-chunk Gram matrices in one AIV block per (batch, head, chunk).
//
// The standalone pair costs 3.7 ms at [1,8192,32] and is DMA bound: the
// preprocess half alone moves 61 KB per chunk (1.0 GB per pass) at ~570 GB/s,
// and a stub that keeps every DataCopy but drops the whole compute chain still
// takes 1.79 of its 1.96 ms.  "Qn"/"Kn"/"Gc" are 32 KB per chunk of that
// traffic and their only consumer is the Gram kernel on the next launch, so
// folding the two stages together deletes the round trip.
//
// The Gram half is unchanged arithmetic and bit-identical to the old
// kernel's "Aqk32"/"Aqk"/"L" outputs: qf/kf here are the same bf16-rounded,
// l2-normalised rows the old kernel loaded back from "Qn"/"Kn", and the
// chunk-centred gate is still the same fp32 value.
//
// The GM copies of Qn/Kn/Gate/Gc are debug-only and skipped when the pointer
// is null ("api.py" passes them only for "return_intermediates").
//
// Per-row scalars (the l2 norms, beta, the chunk-centred gate) are broadcast
// with "Brcb" instead of a 16-iteration "Muls"/"Duplicate" loop: Brcb turns the
// 16 values into a tile with eight 32B blocks per row, and the consumer then
// runs 64 lanes x 16 repeats with "src1RepStride = 1" block (i.e. one scalar
// per repeat; "dstRepStride = 16" blocks walks the 128-lane rows), once for the
// low half and once for the high half.  That is 3 instructions instead of 16
// plus the 16 scalar "GetValue" reads, and it is bit-identical (measured
// max(abs(diff)) = 0.000e+00 on all 13 outputs): 3.114 -> 2.679 ms at
// [1,8192,32] and 1.590 -> 1.373 ms at [1,4096,32].
//
// The kernel is issue-bound, not FLOP-bound (msprof ArithmeticUtilization: the
// fp32 vector ALU is busy 20% of the block, while a micro-benchmark puts a
// fixed ~25-35 cycles on every vector instruction, plus ~1-7 cycles per repeat
// depending on the form).  Three changes follow from that, all bit-identical
// and worth 2.69 -> 2.59 ms at [1,8192,32]:
//   * every input load is issued up front behind its own MTE2->V flag and the
//     wait is deferred to the consumer, so the q/k norms run while G/V/the
//     masks are still in flight (the block used to wait for all five copies);
//   * Qg/Kg/Rk/Rv/BetaOut are stored as soon as they exist, so their MTE3
//     traffic drains behind the Gram loop instead of at the end of the block;
//   * the two "V_S" sync pairs around the l2 norms are dead (nothing reads
//     those reductions with the scalar unit any more) and cost ~2%.
//
// The block walks `unroll` consecutive chunks (the body is byte-identical,
// just wrapped in the loop) because the whole kernel is issue-bound and every
// block pays a fixed setup cost worth ~10% of one chunk's work: 2.679 ->
// 2.342 ms at [1,8192,32] with unroll 8, 0.333 -> 0.308 ms at [1,1024,32]
// with unroll 4, 0.0953 -> 0.0932 ms at [2,1024,4] with unroll 2, all
// bit-identical.  Back-to-back-launch measurements (host launch overhead
// hidden) put the optimum at >= 256 blocks; at chunk counts under 256 the
// loop wrapper itself costs ~6%, so `api.py` leaves those at unroll 1.
//
// A last pass deleted four more instructions per chunk, again bit-identical
// (0.000e+00 on all 13 outputs, 2.289 -> 2.262 ms at [1,8192,32] with the same
// back-to-back harness):
//   * "Muls(gf, gf, aexp)" followed by "Muls(gf, gf, -1)" is one "Muls" with
//     the negated scalar (a sign flip is exact, so this is not a rounding
//     change);
//   * "Muls(t2, t2, -1.0f)" after "gf - gf[15]" is the same as computing
//     "gf[15] - gf" directly - swap the two "Sub" operands *and* their repeat
//     strides (src0 is the fixed row, so its stride is the 0 one);
//   * the A-side triangular mask multiply is a no-op: the Gram loop writes
//     exactly the lower triangle and "Duplicate" already put zeros above it,
//     so "Muls(ga32, redA, scale)" is the whole post-processing - and the
//     "MaskS" tile no longer has to be fetched.  "MaskL" has to stay, because
//     the K-side loop does write L's diagonal and the mask is what zeroes it.
//
// The fast path has no "PipeBarrier<PIPE_ALL>" left except the one after the
// last "post_gram" (the "Gate"/"Gc" ones only run when the caller asks for
// intermediates).  The "Decay" store needs only the MTE3->V half:
// "SetFlag<HardEvent::MTE3_V>" after the copy, "WaitFlag<HardEvent::MTE3_V>"
// before the "Mul" that overwrites the tile - 2.259 -> 2.209 ms at
// [1,8192,32] (R=10, unroll 8, bit-identical), in-pipeline "pre_gram"
// 2.285 -> 2.237 ms of a 7.463 -> 7.433 ms pass.
//
// The pass boundary (and with it the chunk boundary) is two *self-paired*
// pairs, one per hazard, not a drain and not a loop-carried flag chain: the
// MTE3->V drain at the end of the pass body covers "MTE3 read of a stored
// tile -> V write of that tile", and the V->MTE2 marker at the last
// landing-buffer read (the rv cast) covers "V read of qnb/knb/rvb -> the next
// pass's DataCopyPad".  Self-paired means no state crosses the iteration, so
// the priming problem that hangs loop-carried pairs here does not arise; a
// WaitFlag only orders its own pipe's queue, which is why the two hazards need
// two pairs and why a single MTE3->V drain left the loads a pass ahead.  See
// docs/ASCENDC_V1_REFACTOR_PLAN_20260913.md sections 11.12/11.13.
//
// Cost model from probes on this kernel (+8 instructions per chunk, launch
// time at [1,8192,32]): +0.040 ms for 8 one-repeat "Adds" => ~27 cycles per
// vector instruction, +0.056 ms for 8 "Mul"s with 16 repeats => ~0.6 cycles
// per extra repeat, +0.051 ms for 8 one-repeat "Exp" => the special-function
// unit is dearer per repeat but does not dominate.  msprof agrees: the vector
// pipe is busy 70% of this kernel and the instruction count, not the lane
// count, is what it waits on.
//
// Negative results, worth not retrying: dropping the 15 barriers of the gate
// cumsum and/or the 64 of the Gram loop changes nothing (the vector pipe is
// in-order, so they are free); giving the Gram loop a second product tile so
// the A and K halves stop serialising on one buffer changes nothing (the pipe
// is issue-limited, not latency-limited); 256B UB padding on "gb" or "redA"
// costs 4.5% and on "ga"/"gtb" nothing, so the natural layout is already the
// good one; unroll 4/16/32 are all worse than 8.  (An earlier revision of this
// note priced "move the Gram to the Cube" as a wash at this kernel's own
// ~370 GB/s; that was wrong - the publishes ride an idle MTE3, see below.)
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// MIX variant (this file): the two intra-chunk Grams move to the paired Cube.
//
// A stub of the vector-only block with just the 32-iteration Gram loop deleted
// runs 1.158 ms against 2.205 ms for the whole block at [1,8192,32]
// (back-to-back launches, MIN of 10), so the Gram half is 1.05 ms, 47% of the
// stage, and it is the one part of the chunk the vector unit is bad at: 32
// row-broadcast multiplies plus 32 whole-row reductions against a handful of
// instructions for every other step.  msprof agrees the block has no vector
// headroom left (aiv_vec_ratio 0.845).
//
// The split needs three things:
//   * the operands (ga = qf*exp2(gz), gk1 = ga's K side times beta,
//     gb = kf*exp2(-gz)) rounded to bf16 and published to GM: 12 KB per chunk.
//     A store-headroom probe measured 24 KB/chunk of extra MTE3 at 0.047 ms of
//     the 2.2 ms block, so the traffic is nearly free;
//   * the Cube side: Aqk = ga @ gb^T and L = gk1 @ gb^T as two 16x16x128 Mmads
//     that share one L0B operand.  Neither side needs a transpose: Nd2Nz of the
//     [16,128] tile plus a *plain* LoadData, read as B[K=128,N=16] with
//     MmadParams(16,16,128), is the transposed operand (probe in
//     /tmp/kdaval/cubeprobe);
//   * a software pipeline so the cross-core round trip is off the critical
//     path.  The AIV masks chunk u-1's Gram (which the Cube finished while it
//     computed chunk u) and only then publishes chunk u, so the Cube has a
//     whole chunk of vector work to answer in; the AIC is paired with two AIVs
//     (MIX_AIC_1_2) and computes both subcores' Grams per step, which leaves it
//     at ~25% duty.  The Aqk32/L slots double as the
//     Cube->AIV channel (2 KB read + 2 KB write per chunk) so no new buffer is
//     needed for the Gram results; the mask, the scale and the bf16 cast stay
//     on the AIV.
//
// Precision: the Cube forms the same products the vector loop did (both
// operands are exactly bf16 after the cast) with an fp32 accumulator, so the
// only difference is the operand rounding - measured end to end through the
// whole KDA pipeline in docs/ASCENDC_V1_KERNELS.md.
//
// The AIV publishes through a two-deep UB ring: the slot written for chunk u
// was last read by the Cube at step u-2, and the DONE wait for chunk u-1 sits
// between them, so the WAR is covered by the handshake rather than by an extra
// loop-carried flag (those hang in this runtime, see the note below).
//
// NOTE: the body below is sensitive to how it is written - an equivalent
// rewrite that only reformats the buffer declarations or moves the
// "PipeBarrier<PIPE_V>" after the gate re-centring loop trips an aivec error
// (mte error info 0x8030860ef, pc offset ~0x3d8) on this CANN runtime.  Keep
// the layout of this file; verified working on 910_9382 / CANN 9.1.0.
